# Portfolio Builder
Easy to use, portfolio builder for Software Developers or professionals looking to showcase their projects.


## About
This application serves to address two main issues facing software developers and their portfolio websites.

1. Most software developers need a portfolio to showcase their work. However, it may be hard to manage having many different projects and coding your own portfolio website. This application serves to make a simple, easy to use and easy to deploy portfolio website.

2. Many developers make a portfolio website but have very little feedback provided to them. I hope to make this web applicaiton a platform where developers are able to rate and critique eachother's portfolios.
